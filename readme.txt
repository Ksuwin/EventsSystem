Events System (Express.js, Angular2, EJS)

For this App I used: 

- Express.js: web application that serves Angular2 web site and ejs views. I developed RESTful APIs to process 
  http-requests from client side. 

- Angular2 CLI: main web page with current week events.

- Ejs view engine: Event Management web pages.

- JQuery Library: dynamic client-side content 

- A node.js module mongojs: it emulates the official mongodb API as much as possible.

- A node.js module moment.js: Easy parsing, validating, manipulating and displaying  dates and times in JavaScript.
  https://momentjs.com  
  
- MLab(Database-as-a-Service) for interacting with MongoDB Cloud Database. You can create an account on https://mlab.com. 
  MLab provides 500MB free for deploying your database. 

If you click on 'Event Management' of the top-left corner you will be redirected to web page created with ejs views.
